# Teiko Technical Challenge

## Setup and Installation
This guide assumes you already have python and NPM installed on your machine.

Python files live in the `/flask` directory. You'll need to have the `flask` and `pandas` packages either installed globally or in an virtual environment. Once you have that done, open `/flask` in a terminal (with your virtual environment, if applicable) and run `flask run` or `python -m flask run` to start the flask backend.
